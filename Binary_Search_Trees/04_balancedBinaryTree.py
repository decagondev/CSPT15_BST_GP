"""
You are given a binary tree and you need to write a function that can determine if it is height-balanced.

A height-balanced tree can be defined as a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by a maximum of 1.

Example 1:
Given the following tree [5,10,25,None,None,12,3]:

    5
   / \
 10  25
    /  \
   12   3
return True.

Example 2:
Given the following tree [5,6,6,7,7,None,None,8,8]:

       5
      / \
     6   6
    / \
   7   7
  / \
 8   8
return False.
